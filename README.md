# GLM-analysis
The general idea of the project was to perform a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) analysis
to analyze the associated risk of tractors from a data le provided by the insurance company
If P&G. From this, the goal of the model was to determine the associated risk of tractors
belonging to dierent categories compared to some base line group where the relative risk
factor was set to 1. Tari factors could be determined which enabled calculation of the
price of the insurance policy in order to cover expected claim costs of the tractors.
